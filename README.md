# Search for the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background with PPTA DR2

This repository contains the code to reproduce results of the search for a stochastic gravitational-wave background with the second data release (DR2) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA).
 - "run_analysis.py" is the main script to run parameter estimation and model selection.
 - "params" contains confguration files for parameter estimation and/or model selection, priors, output directories, etc. 
 - "slurm" contains slurm submission scripts, with examples of how to launch "run\_analysis.py" from the command line.
